# Context API
A simple example of using React's Context API to transfer data in a way that is similar to props, but not using props at all.

Three-way example:

- Parent to Child
- Child to Parent
- Child to Child

There are three wrappers between the Parent component and the Child component the data is transferred to. They are, as their names suggest, merely wrappers that do not transfer data. This is to illustrate more concretely the use of the Context API. Visually each component has a border (apart from the `App.js`).
